			<h2>About</h2>
				<p> What started out as curiosity quickly turned into a passion when I embarked on my journey to learn computer programming. I started out as a self-taught coder, learning through online courses, then decided to further my knowlede by returning to university to obtain a degree in Computer Science. I have worked on a variety of projects, each one allowing me to expand my knowldge in different area of web development.
